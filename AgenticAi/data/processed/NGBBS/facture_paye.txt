## Process Overview
This is a supplementary procedure for processing recharges via purchase orders (bon de commande) in the NGBSS system for subscribers who have a complete payment relationship within their group.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Group Consultation Verification
**Action**: Verify the payment relationship during group consultation
- Navigate to the group consultation view in NGBSS
- Confirm that the relationship shows as "paiement complet" (full payment)
- **Key Observation**: At this stage, the account displayed is the group account, not the individual subscriber account

### Step 2: Account Identification
**Action**: Identify the correct subscriber account
- Navigate to the "Abonné" (Subscriber) section
- **Important**: The correct individual account will be noted/displayed in this section
- The system will show both the group account and the individual subscriber account

### Step 3: Account Selection
**Action**: Select the appropriate subscriber account
- Locate the dropdown list (liste déroulante)
- From the dropdown menu, select the account of the specific subscriber concerned
- Ensure you're selecting the individual subscriber's account, not the group account

### Step 4: Payment Submission
**Action**: Submit for payment processing
- Click on "Soumettre & paiement" (Submit & payment) button
- This action initiates the payment processing workflow

### Step 5: Payment Method Selection
**Action**: Confirm purchase order payment method
- The system will display the "Bon de Commande" (Purchase Order) payment option
- Verify that this payment method appears correctly
- Proceed with the purchase order payment process

## Key Points to Remember
